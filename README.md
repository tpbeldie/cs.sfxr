A one on one clone of DrPetter's sfxr, built with .NET Framework 2.0, compatible with any .NET Framework/.NET version; 
works even on your grandma's old IBM PC with Windows XP. 

I've fixed all broken features, and is working accurately... somehow.\
There is no longer need for sepearate resource files. Enjoy!
