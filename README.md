A one on one clone of DrPetter's sfxr, built with .NET Framework 2.0, compatible with any .NET Framework/.NET version; 
works even on your grandma's old IBM PC with Windows XP. 

I've fixed all broken features, and is working accurately... somehow.\
There is no longer need for sepearate resource files. Enjoy!

NOTE: If you find any bugs or faults at any given time, please make sure you don't contact me and just restart the app, that should do the trick. It works well enough most of the time and it ain't worth the trouble. ðŸ˜†
